üíß Water: **1/2 cup**

## Outdoor Plants

### How often to water
Depending on the weather.
If it's really hot and sunny they may need watering every evening. Especially the üçã **lemon tree**, cause it likes to be extra.

### How to measure water
Use this bad boy:

### Meet the ~~fockers~~ plants

#### The Trees
‚ÑπÔ∏è Bio: the reason why we can't invite people to sit outside.
üíß Water: **1 watering can split between the 3 of them**

#### The rest
‚ÑπÔ∏è Bio: anything else intentionally or unintentionally growing on our balcony
üíß Water: **1 watering can split between all**


## Foraging Encouraged ‚ù§Ô∏è
Please eat anything that grows ripe enough (tomatoes, strawberries...). It's a shame to let them go to waste.
