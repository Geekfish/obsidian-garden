## Food
### Schedule
‚òÄÔ∏è **Morning:** 1 sachet of wet food each
üåô **Evening**: 1/2 sachet of wet food each + dry food

You can use the measuring cup for dry food.
Milo is a big boy, so it's ok if he eats a bit more than Pinello in the evening.

### ü§¢ Stench-prevention tips
 To avoid things getting super stinky in the summer,
*  rinse the sachets with water before throwing away (garbage under the sink)
* throw away the garbage at the end of the week even if the bin is not full
### Snacks
Feel free to give them some snacks, especially after play. We store these in the cupboard.
* Pinello _loves_ the dried chicken hearts (he screams in joy when you take them out). You can cut these a bit smaller.
* Milo loves sauce/soup. Some days you can put the soup in his wet food bowl.

## Toilets
There are 2 pretty big toilets, so **cleaning them once a day is ok**.
### Litter bin
Don't worry if you've not used one of these before, they're really easy to use.

* [How to replace the cartridge when totally empty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BTc7gBoaXQ) 
  PS: in this case, please don't throw away the plastic case. We keep a few and refill them with bags.
## Vacuum cleaner
Found behind the bathroom door.
### Emptying
* To open: pull the top red handle (you probably want to do that over the garbage bin)
* To close: push the top red handle back down, then close the bottom

## Toys
You can find toys all over the flat, and the bigger ones in storage.
### Pinello vs Plastic
Pinello is sometimes fussy with his food. But if you leave anything like a plastic bag or nylon string or worm-like toys around, he will try to swallow them. So best to put these toys back in storage.
### Milo vs Headbands
His favourite thing. Thankfully Pinello won't eat those.
