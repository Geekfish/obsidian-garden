# On Simplicity

WIP document

A topic that's often on my mind that often comes up when evaluating solutions.

* What is "simple"?
* Complex vs complicated
* Simple is complex
	* Different types of simplicity
	* Simple components, complex systems
	* Simplicity trade-offs (simple interface vs simple implementation)
	* When simplicity/complexity pays off (and when it doesn't)
* Communicating complexity, simply
	* What are the factors that result in different people perceiving something as "simple" and "overly complicated" at the same time
