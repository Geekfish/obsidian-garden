# Karvonen HR training zones

## Background
When training in activities like running or cycling, the concept of *training "zones"* is often used, in order to prescribe different levels of *intensity*.

There is value in training at different levels of intensity (low, moderate, aerobic, unaerobic etc), depending on what an athlete wants to achieve in a specific training session or longer term.

## The general method
There are different ways of figuring out these zones. The most popular one, often also used by fitness programs and apps, relies on knowing one's maximum heart rate and with each zone being a percentage of it.

E.g. for someone with a max heart rate of 185bpm, training at 70% intensity would simply be:
```
185 * 0.7 = 129.5
```

### This doesn't always work

Even when we have the max heart rate figured out, for some people these zones don't seem to correspond to how they actually experience different levels of intensity.

This may be due to them being highly trained athletes, well adapted to higher levels of intensity, or just regular physiological different among individuals.

## Alternative: the Karvonen method

The Karvonen method is an alternative method of calculating *training zones*.

This method calculates percentages based on **heart rate reserve**. In other words, takes both the **max heart rate** and the **resting heart rate** into account.

The full formula is defined as:
```
((Maximum HR â€“ Resting HR) * Intensity) + Resting HR
```

So for someone with 185bpm max and 62bpm resting heart rate, to train at 70% intensity, we would have:

```
((185 - 62) * 0.7) + 62 = 148
```

This yields a very different result from the
