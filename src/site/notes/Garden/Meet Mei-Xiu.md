# Meet Mei-Xiu
Sent to me by its previous host, Stewart Watkiss. Haven't flashed the device yet so it looks like the robot controlling hex is still loaded.

# Environment setup

Started using [`upyed`](https://github.com/ntoll/upyed) and Tom Viner's very convenient [`upyflashed`](https://github.com/tomviner/upyflashed). The tool was exiting with a trace in the event of no hex files being available, so I [opened a PR](https://github.com/tomviner/upyflashed/pull/1) to make this a bit better.

EDIT: Turns out my "fix" was skipping the `sleep` step which caused the loop cycles to be a bit too fast. Good thing Tom caught that ðŸ˜‰

# It's Xmas

The Micro:bit gets a warm Christmas welcome by some of the other flashing LEDs in our house.
