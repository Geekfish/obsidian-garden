# Setup S3 bucket for use with Cloudfront

Part of: [[Garden/Hosting Obsidian S3 media publicly\|Hosting Obsidian S3 media publicly]]

1. Create an S3 bucket
	e.g. `assets.example.com`
   > [!info] Public or Private?
     > Unless you have a specific public use in mind, you can **keep this bucket private**.
2. Create a Cloudfront distribution
	* As `Origin domain` select your S3 bucket
	* You can leave `Custom SSL Certificate` empty to start with and set it up later (see [[Garden/obsidian-public-media/Setup custom AWS CloudFront CNAME\|Setup custom AWS CloudFront CNAME]])
3. Done üç∞
