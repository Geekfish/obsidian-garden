# Project #2: Snowflakes (almost)

Since Christmas often means snow (at least for us living in the northern hemisphere) I thought to try to generate some snowflakes on the microbit.

Since snowflakes are symmetrical, we should only have to create a 3x3 corner and rotate that 45Â° at a time that to get the full shape. End result might resemble a star-wars spaceship instead of snowflakes. Equally seasonal?

Here's how it looked like:
