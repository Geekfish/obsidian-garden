Mei-Xiu (RIP) was a [BBC micro:bit ](https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/mediapacks/microbit)device running MicroPython, one of five devices that were sent out to travel the world and the python community.

I had the chance to play with it during the xmas period in 2015.

This is a series of small posts I made at the time:
